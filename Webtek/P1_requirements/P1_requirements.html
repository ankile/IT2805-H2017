              <h2>Our Client</h2>
              <p>Our client is Stig Fjell, the daily manager of Trondheim Youth Hostel. He has finally realised that to get customers, he must be on the internet, and is therefore in need of a website to promote and help run his business. He is unfortunately fictional.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="s2">
              <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
              <p>Stig Fjell wants to create a web presence for his hostel, because he knows that his target audience exists almost exclusively on the internet and is most easily reached there. He has created a hostel that delivers on price and value, and need a new channel for advertising and branding, so that more people will be able to find it online, before they travel, and not only stumble upon it once they arrive in Trondheim.</p>
              <p>Trondheim Youth Hostel want to deliver a unique and modern place to stay for youths who haven’t seen Trondheim and Norway before, and make use of our dorm complex in more creative ways. We wish to represent the hostel’s style as modern and unique through both the content and style of the website.</p>
              <p>When we’re done, Stig’s biggest problem will be overbooking.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="s3">
              <h2>Audience</h2>
              <p>The main audience are young travellers looking for a cheaper and more laidback option compared to other accommodations in Trondheim, for example people who are enjoying a gap year of travelling or doing interrail for the summer. We are mainly aiming at 18-30 year old travellers, who enjoy socialising and meeting new people while travelling, and who can also be into cultural sightseeings. The social aspect of the hostel will be emphasised on the web site. Another audience could be travellers looking at Trondheim as a pit-stop before going hiking north or south for Trondheim. It’s important to Stig that the target audience must relate to the design and information we show them on the site.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="s4">
            <h2>Content of the Website and Organization</h2>
            <p>The page wants to draw potential customers to the hostel, therefore the frontpage will comprise a large slideshow of pictures of the rooms and common area, to catch the attention of the visitor. Underneath the pictures will be a general description of the hostel and types of rooms, and the services it provides, and why travellers should consider just our hostel.</p>
            <p>We want the layout on the front page to be clean and minimalistic. It’s also important that booking and rooms are straightforward and easy to deal with. From the main page, one will be able to navigate the site with a navigation bar.</p>
            <p>The navigation bar will have several links, including Rooms, About, FAQ, Contact, Booking and Tourism. The bedrooms page will feature large pictures of the rooms, accompanied of a little text describing each room, and maybe even a particular good review of that room. Underneath there will be a similar setup for the living rooms and breakfast area. On the rooms page there will be links taking one to a picture gallery with more pictures.
</p>
            <p>The about page will be a page outlining more about the hostel, for example the history of the hostel, location and vision and goals. Here it’ll be natural to have a picture of some of the staff and a picture of the hostel from the outside, and a explanation of where to go to find it.</p>
            <p>The contact page will contain direct contact info (email, phone number, etc.) on the top, and a contact form underneath, used for questions and booking.
</p>
            <p>The FAQ page will try to answer some of the questions travellers often ask before they come to the hostel. It’ll be natural to have all the questions in a horizontal accordion, that expands and shows the answer to a question once you click it.
</p>
            <p>Lastly, the tourism page will show out-of-towners all the amazing things one can see and do while in Trondheim. There will be large pictures and warm words.

              <h2>Final Location of the Website</h2>
              <p>Since our client is imaginary, the page will not reside anywhere particular when the project is over.</p>
